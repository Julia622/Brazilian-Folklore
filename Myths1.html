    <h1>Saci-Pererê</h1>

<p>Saci-pererê is a very mischievous character who enjoys playing pranks on animals and people. 
   According to the stories, their main pranks are braiding the animals' tails at night, hiding objects 
   (such as seamstresses' thimbles), whistling very shrilly to scare travellers, swapping the salt container 
   for the sugar container and distract the cooks so they can burn the food.</p>

<p>Saci is the guardian of herbs and medicinal plants, which is why it confuses people who try to take them 
   without authorization. He knows the preparation techniques and knows how to use plants for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>Legend guarantees that to capture the Saci-pererê, a person must throw a sieve into the whirlwinds. 
   Therefore, after capturing it, it is necessary to remove its cap to trap it in a bottle. Finally, when it dies, 
   Saci becomes a poisonous mushroom.</p>

   <h1>Mula sem Cabeça</h1>

<p>There are different versions of the story of the headless mule. In one of them, it is said that if a woman slept 
    with her boyfriend before marriage, she could be bewitched and become a headless Mule. This version was linked to 
    the traditions of families who sought control over their daughters' romantic relationships. It was a way of keeping 
    them up to the moral standards of the time.</p>

<p>Another version of the legend states that any woman who had romantic relationships with a priest would be punished and 
   turned into a headless mule. Of a moral and religious nature, this legend aimed to intimidate women who were considering 
   having a romantic relationship with the priests of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>According to the narrative, the enchantment took place on Thursday nights, when the woman was transformed into a headless mule. 
   She threw fire from her neck and ran through the woods and fields. With his paws, he tore apart animals and people that appeared 
   in front of him. The enchantment disappeared with the third crow of the rooster. At that moment, the woman returned to her normal 
   self, generally exhausted and injured.</p>

<p>To end once and for all the enchantment that fell upon the sinner, someone would have to rip off the mule's bridle or pierce it with 
   some sharp object in order to draw blood, even if it was just a drop. The enchantment could also be removed by the priest (the lover), 
   who would have to curse her seven times before celebrating masses.</p>

   <h1>Curupira</h1>

<p>The Curupira, known as the “demon of the forest”, whistles and uses false signals. It brings together many stories that involve 
   inexplicable mysteries, for example, the disappearance of hunters, as well as the forgetting of the paths. They say that with 
   its feet facing backwards, the Curupira deceives and confuses people who damage its habitat, for example, hunters, loggers, 
   woodcutters, etc.</p>

<p>This folkloric character, who loves to smoke and drink alcohol, does not like heavily populated places and, for this reason, 
  prefers to live in forests. Another characteristic, and perhaps the Curupira's weak point, is its curiosity. Thus, the legend 
  warns that to escape its traps, the person must make a ball of vine and hide the end well. Very curious, he is entertained by 
  the ball of yarn and the person manages to escape.</p>

<p>To this day, so that they are not bothered by the Curupira, many hunters and woodcutters usually offers alcoholic drinks 
   and tobacco when they arrive in the forest.</p>
