<p>Brazilian folklore is the set of cultural manifestations that characterise national identity. 
    It is the result of the miscegenation of the people who inhabited Brazil, such as indigenous 
    people, Africans and Portuguese.</p>

    music, popular festivals, literature, cuisine, games, dances and other traditions that are 
    passed down from generation to generation, however we will focus more on the tales and myths 
    of Brazilian folklore. To learn more about them, here are some of the most popular tales
