<p>Brazilian folklore is the set of cultural manifestations that characterise national identity. 
    It is the result of the miscegenation of the people who inhabited Brazil, such as indigenous 
    people, Africans and Portuguese.</p>

    music, popular festivals, literature, cuisine, games, dances and other traditions that are
